We would like to thank the ITU for informing us about the ongoing INSA work [1], as it relates to “Functional architecture for intelligent awareness of network status based on federated learning”.
 
For your information, the IETF has chartered a new Working Group (WG) on Network Management OPerations (NMOP WG) [2]. The WG focuses on solving network management problems faced by soliciting input from operators on operational issues arising from deployment of network management technologies, having discussions and conducting experiments including the wider network management ecosystem as it relates to management protocols defined by IETF.
 
The NMOP WG encourages the use of NMOP WG mailing list [3] as the most effective and expedient way of exchanging information, answering questions, and progressing any work. It will consider presentation requests from the ITU group that describe issues that you experience when operationalizing the INSA model, including, but not limited to, integrating and consuming existing data models. Such issues can also be shared during formal WG meetings. Requests for presentations can be sent to the NMOP Chairs [4].
 
Following is the schedule of upcoming IETF meetings [5]:

- 20 July 2024 - 26 July 2024, Vancouver Canada
- 02 Nov 2024 - 08 Nov 2024, Dublin Ireland
 
We look forward to participation from the ITU on the NMOP WG mailing list and meetings from those in ITU interested in the work being done by the WG.
 
NMOP Chairs & Area Director
